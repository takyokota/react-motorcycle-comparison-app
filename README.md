This is a responsive motorcycle comparison single page application (SPA) using React, Tailwind and an API. A user can pick a set of years, makes and models of motorcycles to compare. After the submit button is clicked, a table shows a comparison of the specifications between two selected motorcycles. To make this project simple, the selections of years, makes, models are limited.
